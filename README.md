Repository of packages and info for the SV-ROS Intro To ROS training series

This repo will contain the software and documents for the SV-ROS 2015 Intro to Ros training series.

As of January, 2018, many updates have occurred, so we will be updating the documentation.

The series involes a set of talks presenting a general introduction to ROS and building ROS Robots.

Reference Robot designs are provided as a guide to getting started.

The first of these is a robot built on the Neato BV80 base and using a Raspberry PI III. The PI III has built in WiFi and Blue Tooth, but because of this the default names of ttyUSB0  needs to be changed to ttyACM0 in order to connect to the robot.

The ROS packages and drivers for this robot can be found in the bv80bot folder(s).

The driver is based on a modified Neato Driver first created by Michael Ferguson.

bv80bot
-------

  The robot is built from a Raspberry PI III SBC and a Neato BV80 robot vacume base.
  
  Follow the instructions from Ubiquity Robotics for building a ROS image on the PI.
  https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com   This will allow you to place a ROS image on a 16g SD card which can 
  then directly boot the PI with Lubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic. Since this image is for another robot, 
  additional modifications to the PI's OS will be required to make a working robot.
  
  
  Also install ALL of the following(Note some of the turtlebot packages may not be available in kinetic, this needs testing):
  ```
  sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-xacro ros-kinetic-turtlebot-description ros-kinetic-turtlebot-navigation ros-kinetic-turtlebot-teleop ros-kinetic-yocs-cmd-vel-mux ros-kinetic-yocs-velocity-smoother
```
  
  Git clone this repo to the catkin_ws/src folder on the PI and you Laptop/PC.
  
  <b>Note: do this on both your PC/Laptop and the Raspberry PI.</b>, 
  
  you need copies of the files on both computers.
  
  ```
  cd ~/catkin_ws/src
  git clone https://github.com/SV-ROS/intro_to_ros.git
  ```
  Optional, but highly recommended:
  
  ```
   git clone /https://github.com/pirobot/rbx1
   git clone https://github.com/vanadiumlabs/arbotix_ros
  ```
  
  do a catkin_make on the workspace (on both computers)
  
  ```
  roscd
  cd ..
  catkin_make
  ```
  
  Also make sure you have chrony installed on both the PC/Laptop and the PI:
  
  ```
  sudo apt-get install chrony
  ```
 
  There are a number of different way to launch the robot depending on where you want to run the packages.
  
  The robot can be run in two modes - mapping and navigation, you must first run the robot in mapping mode to create a   map to use later for navigation.
  
  
  Packages for mapping an navigation can be run either on the robot or the PC/Laptop, the following gives the launch     commands for each configuration:
  
  <b>Mapping Mode:</b>
  
    Launch the ros packages for mapping on the robot:
    
    on the Raspberry PI -- roslaunch bv80bot_node bv80bot_base_map.launch
    on the PC/Laptop    -- roslaunch bv80bot_node bv80bot_gui_only.launch
    
    
    Launch the ros packages for mapping on the PC/Laptop:
    
    on the Raspberry PI -- roslaunch bv80bot_node bv80bot_base_only.launch
    on the PC/Laptop    -- roslaunch bv80bot_node bv80bot_map_gui.launch
    
Drive around with the joystick/keyboard until you have a good enough map (see below for telop configuration).

Once you have crated a map you like you must save it before you stop running the nodes launched above.
You can save the map to the PI or the Laptop/PC, you should save it to the computer you intend to run the nav nodes on later.

So on the apropreate computer, (PC/Laptop or the PI) save the map as follows:
```
roscd neato_2dnav/maps
rosrun map_server map_saver
```
The map will be saved as two files in the .../neato_2dnav/maps folder, map.yaml, map.pgm


  <b>Navigation Mode:</b>
  
    Launch the ros packages for navigation on the robot (if you saved your map to the PI):
    
    on the Raspberry PI -- roslaunch bv80bot_node bv80bot_base_nav.launch
    on the PC/Laptop    -- roslaunch bv80bot_node bv80bot_gui_only.launch
    
    
    Launch the ros packages for navigation on the PC/Laptop (if you saved your map to the PC/Laptop):
    
    on the Raspberry PI -- roslaunch bv80bot_node bv80bot_base_only.launch
    on the PC/Laptop    -- roslaunch bv80bot_node bv80bot_nav_gui.launch
    
  You should now be able to set the robots pose in rviz and set nav goals for the robot to goto with the 2d nav goal button in rviz.
    
    
  <b>Teleop Configuration:</b>
  
  The launch files mentioned can be configured to use 1 of 4 teleop controllers:
  - ps3 joystick
  - xbox360 joystick
  - logitech joypad
  - keyboard

  There is an argument at the top of the bv80bot_base.launch file as shown below:

  ~/catkin_ws/src/intro_to_ros/bv80bot/bv80bot_node/launch/include/bv80bot_base.launch
  ```
  <!-- Change this to use a different joystick controller -->
  <!-- Set the default value for the 'teleop_controler' arg below to one of the folowing values to select the controler you are using to teleop the robot:
        ps3
        xbox360
        keyboard
        logitech
  -->
  <arg name="teleop_controler"   default="xbox360" />
  ```
  
  Change the value of the default argument shown above to one of the indicated choices to change your controler settings/configuration.
